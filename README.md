  Hyperapp 2.0 starter
</h1>

Starter template to quickly build front-ends using Hyperapp with a modern configuration and best-practices in mind.  


## ðŸš€ Quick start: 
[Click here to use this template](https://github.com/loteoo/hyperapp-starter/generate), or run these commands:  
```
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/loteoo/hyperapp-starter.git

cd hyperapp-starter

npm install         # Install dependencies
npm start           # Dev server + live reload
```


```
npm run build   # Build for production and generate service worker
```
Or use a [.zip download](https://github.com/loteoo/hyperapp-starter/archive/master.zip)


## Features
- Uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for compilation, dev server and hot module reloading.  (It's  blazing fast, easy to use and reliable)
- Works offline out of the box using [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) to generate service workers and precache application files
- PWA/SPA ready with a default web app manifest
- Sane CSS defaults using [sanitize.css](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/), a best-practices CSS reset
- Uses the [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) JavaScript style guide with eslint  
-  Automatic import of the `h` function (say goodbye to that `h` import!)
- [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and all of the ES6-7-8-9 goodies are ready to go thanks to Parcel.


## Sample file structure
Proposed folder structure as your project grows. Adapt it to your needs.  

```
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                             # Compiled static files (parcel output)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                              # Application source code

### FAQ:

> How do I deploy my app?   

By default, apps using this starter can be considered *static sites*, which means you can deploy for free on services like Netlify and Github Pages.

> Why so many commits?   

Even is there are not that many files in this starter, it's configuration has been meticulously though over and over to make sure you hit the ground running and focus on your idea.


### Need routing, code splitting and pre-rendering out of the box?   

Use [this](https://github.com/loteoo/hyperapp-site-generator-starter) instead!
